# young-flock
`Young Flock` is an experimental intelligence project. It is equal parts learning opportunity and fever dream (more literally than you might expect). 

It is motivated by a fundamental belief that human-beings benefit most greatly from encountering things they do not initially understand.

The current build of Young Flock is referred to as `Abuk` after the [Dinka first woman and goddess of gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuk_(mythology)). It is the first build of the project.

## Key assumptions
`Young Flock Abuk` has eight fundamental laws:
1. There are objects, `akis`.
2. An `aki` exists in a space, `braid`, potentially with other `akis`.
3. An `aki` in a `braid` has a position encoded by a [UTF-8](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3629) string, `beway`. 
4. An `aki` in a `braid` can act by emitting a [UTF-8](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3629) string, `do`.
5. `Dos` in a `braid` are deemed possible or impossible by an arbitrary constraint, `doughnut`.
6. `Dos` in a `braid` are applied in cycles, `baals`.
7. All `dos` in `baal` are resolved by an arbitrary system, `decanter`.
8. A `decanter` resolves `dos` to `drops`, which must be applied to the `aki`.

These laws will be frequently supplemented by user defined constraints and values. 

## `beway`
`beway` encodes the position of an `aki` (object) in a `braid` (space). 
- Loosely based on the Chinese 地位 (Dìwèi = status)
- Because that's the _way it be_
